# Three-Five-Seven
logic game where you have to remove items from the stacks containing 3, 5 and 7 items until there is only one left (the player who gets the last item loses).

the game starts with the 3 stacks that we will call A, B and C contaning all of their items (A = 3 , B = 5, C = 7):

    A        B        C
   x x     x x x    x x x x
   
   x        x x      x x x
 
 Then each player takes turns removing any number of items from a stack on their turn. A player can remove items from only one stack on their turn, so either stack A or B or C. 
 
 the objective of the game is to remove items from the stacks such a way that the opponen will be left with the last item (and lose the game).
